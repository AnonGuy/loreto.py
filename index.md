# Loreto.py
A management system for the loreto subdomains, built primarily using Python.
# Requirements:
A portable python excecutable is stored in the `python` folder, and the `requests` module is included with prerequisites in `Loreto.py/modules` <br />
If these folders cannot be found, the version of Python I am using for this project is 3.6.4: <br />
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/ <br />
The requests module can also be installed using `pip` package manager: <br />
```
pip install requests
```

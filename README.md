# Loreto.py
A management system for the loreto subdomains, built primarily using Python.
# Requirements:
A portable python excecutable is stored in the `python` folder, and the `requests` module is included with prerequisites in `Loreto.py/modules`. If these folders cannot be found, the version of Python I am using for this project is 3.6.4:

The requests module can also be installed using `pip` package manager:
```
pip install requests
```
